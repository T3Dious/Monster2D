Monster AI & UI System for Unity
This repository provides a modular and extensible Monster AI and UI system for Unity, featuring:

Monster AI with pathfinding, avoidance, melee and ranged attacks, and loot drops.
Monster UI for displaying health, name, and level on mouse hover.
Monster Stats as ScriptableObjects for easy configuration and reuse.
Features.

1. Monster AI (MonsterAI2D.cs)
Movement & Pathfinding:
Monsters move toward the player, avoid obstacles and other monsters, and rotate smoothly to face their target.
Attack Logic:
Melee: Attacks when within close range.
Ranged/Magic: Shoots projectiles at the player when within attack range and line of sight, with controllable fire rate.
As the monsters too will attack and move to increase the chance that you may mis-shot them.

Note: Soon there will be an update to control the range of the moving while attacking the player depending the monster type
Loot Drops:
Drops items on death, with drop chances based on item rarity (common to legendary).
Health Management:
Takes damage from bullets and dies when health reaches zero.
Performance:
Uses efficient checks and can be extended with pooling and optimization strategies.


3. Monster UI (MonsterUI.cs)
Dynamic UI:
Shows monster health, name, and level when the mouse hovers over the monster.
Smooth Health Bar:
Health bar smoothly interpolates to reflect damage.
UI Reset:
UI resets when the mouse exits the monster.

4. Monster Stats (MonsterStats.cs)
ScriptableObject:
All monster stats are defined in a ScriptableObject for easy editing and reuse.
Configurable:
Health, level, attack damage, attack range, cooldowns, movement, and more.
Monster Types:
Supports Melee, Ranged, and Magic types.

Legendary: 2%
Multiple Drops:
Monsters can drop up to a configurable maximum number of items.
